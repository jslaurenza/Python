You create a domesticated LLC by obtaining a certificate of good standing from the old state and filing it, along with articles of
domestication, with the secretary of state or other agency in charge of business filings in your new state. You’ll then need to
dissolve the LLC in the old state.

Domesticating provides several benefits including keeping the same bank accounts, tax ID number, credit rating and maintaining previous
business relationships.
Additionally, you’ll only be located in one state, so you won’t have to meet two states’ LLC requirements like you will need to in 
the second option below.
